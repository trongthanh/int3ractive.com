The site includes 3 simple fun games (one of them was removed for the reason I don't know) which are totally unrelated to Comdemned 2 and some other activities related to the game. This site was finished in 4/2008. By the time of this post, the site is still live at: <a href="http://www.offsettheevil.com/">http://www.offsettheevil.com/</a><div>
