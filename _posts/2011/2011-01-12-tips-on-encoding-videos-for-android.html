<p>As a Flash Professional user, you probably have Adobe Media Encoder installed on your computer. This is a great tool to encode videos not only for Flash video player but also for other H.264-enabled devices like iPhone and Android. However, when I tried to encode a video using a random H.264 preset, my phone (a Milestone 2) could not play the video. This means that not every export settings is compatible with the phone’s internal video encoder.</p> <p>So which preset should we choose for the export settings?</p><a name='more'></a> <p>I suggest you start with a preset for mobile such as <em>“Apple iPod, iPhone (Widescreen) Video”</em> (assuming Adobe Media Encoder CS5). For a Motorola phone like mine which has higher screen resolution than said preset I have successfully encoded my video with <em>“YouTube Widescreen SD”</em> for a better quality video. From these presets, you can tweak the settings a little bit to perfectly match your phone’s screen. Typically, you can set size and bitrate of the video and leave other settings alone.</p> <p>I found these settings are perfect for my Motorola Android phone (854x480):</p> <ul> <li>Format: H.264  <li>Preset: YouTube Widescreen SD  <li>Frame Width: 854 (or leave it as 640)  <li>Frame Height: 480 (or leave it as 360)  <li>Target Bitrate: 1  <li>Maximum Bitrate: 2</li></ul> <p>Of course my source video has aspect ratio of 16x9. Otherwise, I would select a similar preset for 4x3 videos. You can try other presets at your own risk.</p> <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="media encoder" border="0" alt="media encoder" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_47w2iQ8-NcE/TS0x5LahEsI/AAAAAAAACs8/KVy_i362AS8/media%20encoder%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="471"> </p> <p></p> <p><font size="1">[Vietnamese tag: Vài lưu ý khi tạo video cho điện thoại Android với chương trình Adobe Media Encoder]</font></p>
