My going back to Flash to experiment on Stage3D. The animation make use of<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;Flare3D engine. Thanks to its built-in shaders and particles components, I was able to create the fireworks and the lightning effects without much trouble. However there's still room to improve the fireworks effect with more particles.</span><br />
