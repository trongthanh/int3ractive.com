This will be a living reference blog post that I'll keep updating.

When I started my software engineering career, I was fully immerged with GUI by the OS and the tooling I used. With irritation at first, I had to self-taught my terminal skills because some of the tasks demanded. However, the more I advanced in my career, the more I see how powerful and convenient CLI can be. Through the years, I had to look up every command that is needed by my job, as a coder, writer, devops and even as casual user, and kept the command usage in a long note. I'm copying and organizing them here for my own reference as well as may it be useful for other peeps.
