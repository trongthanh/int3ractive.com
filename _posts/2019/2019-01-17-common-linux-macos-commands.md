This will be a living reference blog post that I'll keep updating.

When I started my software engineering career, I was fully immerged with GUI and mouse pointers by the OS and the tooling I used. With irritation at first, I had to self-taught my terminal skills because some of the tasks demanded. However, the more I advanced in my career, the more I see how powerful and convenient CLI (command line interface) can be. Through the years, I had to look up every command that is needed by my job, as a coder, writer, devops and even as casual user, and kept the command usage in a long note. I'm migrating and organizing them here for my own reference as well as may it be useful for other peeps.

Sure you can further look up command usage in [cheat sheets](http://cheat.sh/) or Google them up if you know what command to use, but for my younger self as CLI noob, I had no ideas what command to use as well as which tasks are possible on the terminal. Therefore, this mini cheat sheet is how I get on with the CLI bandwagon.

> I'm composing below snippets and headings following [devhints.io](https://devhints.io) markdown structure with intention that this may be re-deployed in that format later.

**Note:** these commands of course use Bash or compatible shells (ZSH, fish), which is available as default in Linux and macOS.

## Navigate file systems

### Display full path of current working directory:

```sh
pwd
```

### List folder content:

```sh
# list content of current folder
ls
# list content (even hidden files) of current folder
ls -a
# list content of current folder with extra metadata columns
ls -l
```

**Note:** The terms **folder** and **directory** are interchangeable.

### Change directory (a.k.a cd):

```sh
# go to a folder with absolute path (start with /)
cd /home/user/documents
# go to a child folder from current folder (./ optional)
cd work/projects/client
# go to parent folder
cd ..
# go to user's home folder (from anywhere)
cd ~
```

### Display byte size of current directory and sub-directories

```sh
# get size of current and its direct sub-directories
du -chd 1

# get size of a single directory
du -sh node_modules/
```

- `-d`: max depth (if omitted, display all sub-directories recursively)
- `-h`: use human-readable size
- `-s`: display only 1 entry for each specified directory

### Find files via name:

#### Find files with name in current directory and its children:

```sh
find . -type f -name "postgis-2.0.0”
```

Type: `f` (file); `d` (directory)

#### Find all files in a folder with pattern and execute command on it

```sh
find . -name '*.js' -exec [command] '{}' \;
```

Note:
`{}` is the path to the file of each loop entry
`\;` is the terminate character

Example:
```sh
find . -name '*.js' -exec jscodeshift -t migrate-to-modern-1.0.js '{}' \;
```

#### Find and remove all `node_modules` folder recursively

```sh
# Dry run:
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -exec echo "{}" +
# Do it:
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

### Search for pattern in files with `grep`

```
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
```

- `-r` or `-R` is recursive,
- `-n` is line number, and
- `-w` stands for match the whole word.
- `-l` (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.

Along with these, `--exclude`, `--include`, `--exclude-dir` flags could be used for efficient searching:

```sh
# This will only search through those files which have .c or .h extensions:
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

# This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:
grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"

# For directories it's possible to exclude a particular directory(ies) through --exclude-dir parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching *.dst/:
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
```

### Working with file owner and permission

#### Changing file permissions

```sh
# Change permission of a file using octal number
chmod 600 key.pem
# (note: don't use same octal number on both files and directories)

# Add run (execute) permission to all users
chmod a+x key.pem

# Add write permission to user, remove read permission from group
chmod u+w,g-r key.pem

# Recursively set exact permission
chmod -R u=r project/
```

#### Changing file owner

```sh
# Change owner of files and directories recursively to user:group
chown -R thanh:admin /usr/local/
```

Note: add `sudo` if needed.

### Viewing files content:

```sh
# print content of a whole file
cat file.txt

# print only the last 20 lines of a text file
tail -n 20 errors.log
```

### Make new files & directories:

```sh
# Make an empty file
touch filename

# Make a directory
mkdir src

# Make a deeply nested directory and any directories between
mkdir -p project/private/devops/nginx
```

### Copy and link files

```sh
# copy a file
cp from/path to/path

# create symbolic link
ln -s source_file target_file
```

### Move files and folders

```sh
# Move and rename a file
mv from_file to_file
# Move multiple files to a target directory
mv file1 file2 file3 directory
```

### Edit file content:

```sh
# edit a file
vim README.md
# Easier editor on Linux
nano README.md

# set content of a file with echo
echo 'hello' > file
# append some text to an existing file (on new line)
echo 'world' >> file

# set file content using tee (where sudo is required)
echo "replication:" | sudo tee -a /etc/mongod.conf
# -a is for append
```

### Replace text inline inside a text file:

```sh
sed -i -e "s/old_text/new_text/g" hello.txt
```

- `-i` replace inline
- `-e` followed by an expression
- `s/old_text/new_text/g` replace string from -> to

### Compress and uncompress

#### Unzip (uncompress) .zip archives:

```sh
# unzip and extract to same folder
unzip file.zip
# unzip and extract to another folder
unzip file.zip -d another/folder
```

> In Ubuntu, if `unzip` command does not exist, install with `sudo apt install unzip`

#### Compress a whole folder with tar + gzip

```sh
tar -czvf dump.tar.gz dump/
```

Mnemonic for the command flags `-czvf` (with some joking): _**C**ompress **Z**e **V**ucking **F**ile_

#### Uncompress a tar.gz file:

```sh
tar -xzvf dump.tar.gz
tar -xzvf dump.tar.gz -C target/folder/
```

Mnemonic for the command flags `-xzvf` (with some joking): _E**x**tract **Z**e **V**ucking **F**ile_

### Remove files & directories

```sh
# Remove a file
rm file.txt

# Remove a directory
rm -r directory

# Remove all html file in current folder
rm *.html
```

- `-r` recursive (required for directory)
- `-f` force remove (if files are read-only)

## Get server / machine info

### Monitor system resource and workload with `top` command:

```sh
top
```

### To sort and configure `top` command

#### In Linux:

- Capital `P` sort by CPU
- Capital `M` sort by Mem
- `c` to toggle full command path
- `e` to switch memory unit
- `m` to switch memory total display

#### In macOS:

- Type `o`, then key in `cpu` to sort by CPU
- Type `o`, then key in `mem` to sort by Memory

### Get CPU, memory info (Linux only)

```sh
cat /proc/cpuinfo
lscpu

cat /proc/meminfo
```

### List all disks on machine (Linux only)

```sh
sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL
```

### Shows the amount of disk space used and available on current machine

```sh
df

#With file system type (EXT4, XFS...)
df -Th
```

## Working with remote servers

### Connect to remote server shell via SSH:

```sh
# Connect via provided username and password
ssh username@hostdomain.com
# Connect via secret *.pem key
ssh username@hostdomain.com -i /path/to/key.pem
```

Note: `key.pem` must have permission octal less than or equal 600

### Check which distro & distro version

```sh
# try either
uname -r
lsb_release -a
```

#### For CentOS only:

```sh
rpm --query centos-release
```

### Copying from and to remote server with `scp`

#### Copy the file "foobar.tgz" from the remote host to current dir in local host

```sh
scp remote-host:/home/user/foobar.tgz ./
```

`remote-host` is a pre-configured host name in `~/.ssh/config`

#### Copy the file "foobar.tgz" from the local host to a remote host

```sh
scp -i key_file.pem foobar.tgz remote-host:/some/remote/directory
```

#### Copy whole directory from the local host to a remote host

```sh
scp -r uploads/ remote-host:/some/remote/directory
```

Result will be new folder copied to `/some/remote/directory/uploads` at remote.

## Git and file download

### Some Git tips

```sh
# Check diff change list with a COMMIT hash
git diff COMMIT^!

# Check diff against last change
git log -p [--follow] [-1] <path>
# Use --follow if file renamed
```

More: [git commands and aliases](https://github.com/trongthanh/dotfiles/blob/master/ubuntu/.git_aliases).

### Download files with `curl`

```sh
# Download and display file content on terminal
curl google.com
# Download a file and specify a new filename
curl http://example.com/file.zip -o new_file.zip
# Download multiple files (and save exact file names from remote)
curl -O URLOfFirstFile -O URLOfSecondFile
# Download a file and follow redirects
curl -L http://example.com/file
# Resume a previously failed download
curl -C - -o partial_file.zip http://example.com/file.zip
```

### Download all URL listed in a text file (each link on a line)

```sh
cat photos.txt | xargs -n 1 curl -LO
```

## Miscellaneous

### Generate SSH key

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Tunnel MongoDB connection from remote to local

```sh
ssh user@host -i private-key.pem -L 27018:localhost:27017
```

(27018 is local, 27017 is remote server)

### Convert a PDF to multiple jpg files

Need to install [`imagemagick`](https://www.imagemagick.org/) first:

```sh
convert -density 300 -trim test.pdf -quality 100 test.jpg
```

### Merge multiple jpg files into one PDF document

Need `imagemagick` as well.

```sh
# jpg files are named so that they appear in correct order
convert -density 150 *.jpg passport.pdf
```

### Convert mp4 to webm with FFMPEG
