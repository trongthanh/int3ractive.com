<p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://overtlyopen.com/cartoons/f-2010-03-21-evolution-death-flash.png" width="400" height="293" /> </p>  <p>Since the event that Flash is not supported by Apple’s latest “magical” gadget – the iPad, there came a lot of debates with Flash platform against others, from HTML5 (the biggest), to it’s poor performance on MAC/iPhone OS and even to user experiences in touch devices,…</p>  <p>This post of mine is to bookmark any interesting read related to or address those debates, especially, the so-called “The Great Flash vs HTML5 Debate of 2010”. I admit that I’m bias so maybe most of the links here are pro-Flash. Anyway, you can read the comments for counter-arguments but I’ve seen a lot of *bullshit* yell-outs against Flash with no proof or reasonable points at all.</p>  <p>I’ll update this post regularly whenever I come across any read-worthy articles (and sort them in chronological order).</p> <a name='more'></a>  <ul>   <li><strong>Kevin Lynch’s </strong><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/02/open_access_to_content_and_app.html" target="_blank"><strong>Open Access to Content and Applications</strong></a> – 2010-02-02&#160; <br />&#160; “<font face="time"><font face="Times New Roman">The Flash team will drive innovation over the coming years as they have over the past decade to enable experiences that aren't otherwise possible. With the ability to update the majority of Web clients in less than a year, Flash can make this innovation available to our customers much more quickly than HTML across a variety of browsers.”</font>&#160; <br /></font>Follow up the post, Kevin has a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/02/open_access_to_content_and_app.html#comment-2137153" target="_blank">comment</a> reveal Flash team effort to prevent crash:&#160; <br />&#160; “<font face="Times New Roman">Before we release a new version of Flash Player we run more than 100,000 test cases and have built an automated system that has scanned over 1 million SWFs that we use for testing from across the web. Our QA lab has a very large variety of machines to represent the machines in real use on the web.”</font> </li>    <li><strong>**** Grant Skinner’s </strong><a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2010/02/my_thoughts_on.html" target="_blank"><strong>thought on the future of Flash</strong></a> – 2010-02-03       <br />&#160;&#160; <font face="Times New Roman">”This skill set is applicable to so many things: WPF on Windows, Cocoa development on Mac / iPhone (ex.
