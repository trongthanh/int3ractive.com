This is my adaptation from the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js" target="_blank">Three.js</a> <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/canvas_geometry_birds.html" target="_blank">Birds&nbsp;Demo</a>&nbsp;which was featured in the famous HTML5 Music Interactive Film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/">The Wilderness Downtown</a>.<br />
<br />
The original birds demo was done by Mr.Doob based on the <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/6910" target="_blank">boids simulation</a>. You can read more about behind the scene of The Wilderness Downtown and the flocks of birds simulation <a href="http://ricardocabello.com/blog/post/705" target="_blank">from his blog here</a>. (Thank Mr. Doob for your awesome <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js" target="_blank">Three.js</a> library and the nice bird demo.)<br />
<br />
The significant adaptations that I made to this school of fishes simulation are: the fish objects are PlaneGeometry with bitmap texture; some tweaks to the boids' speed and movement to make them more fish-like; and making the fish wiggle its tail instead of bird wings' flapping.<br />
<br />
This fish and the bird demos are used in my side-project for my friend's HTML5 portfolio.<br />

Now, <a href="http://labs.int3ractive.com/javascript/canvas/fish-boids/" target="_blank">go see the demo</a>. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/trongthanh/trongthanh.github.com/tree/master/javascript/canvas/fish-boids" target="_blank">Github</a>.
