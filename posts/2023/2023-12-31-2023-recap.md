This blog is getting quite some dust. It's been a while and I was too busy with daywork, technical research and especially a family with 2 kids. I regreted a little bit that I should have kept a habit of writing.

Anyhow, here I am, at the end of of 2023. I jotting down my recap of 2023 as a chance to look back and appreciate what I have achieved and also to restart my writing habit.
