<p>Pyco Flash Department has just released its beta version of Pyco Flash Framework (PFF). Its capabilities are demonstrated via our team’s minisite at <a href="http://www.pycoflash.co.cc">www.pycoflash.co.cc</a></p>  <p>This framework is aim to </p>  <ul>   <li>Set up a standard foundation for almost all Pyco Flash projects. I must say “almost” because some projects may not benefit from deploying PFF, especially ones that are too small and their file size is really a matter. (PFF and PureMVC take up to ~ 90 kB in the main swf).</li>    <li>Reduce the time and hassle of setting up the same project’s frame and common components over again. And therefore, reduce the effort spending on the project.</li>    <li>Drive team members to a new development approach which helps improve teamwork collaboration and source code’s maintainability</li> </ul>  <p>PFF features some of the latest techniques and approaches in the Flash universe:</p>  <ul>   <li>Flex SDK compilation: </li> </ul>  <ul>   <ul>     <li>Deploy FlashCS 3/4 &amp; Flex SDK workflow </li>      <li>Using precompiled libraries SWC extensively to separate UI and logic and to accelerate project build time </li>      <li>All SWFs are compiled using <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk" target="_blank">Flex SDK</a> compiler </li>      <li>Build and deployment can be automated using build script like FlexANT, ANT, batch…</li>   </ul> </ul>  <ul>   <li>The framework core is based on <a href="http://puremvc.org/" target="_blank">PureMVC</a> and <a href="http://trac.puremvc.org/Utility_AS3_Loadup" target="_blank">Loadup</a> utility</li>    <li>An MVC-based page manager. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <ul>     <li>The page manager supports external (loaded) and internal pages. <i>Demo: Login form is an internal page (no waiting for loading). Researches' framework top page is a internal blank containing page</i></li>      <li>Popups are supported (special pages which appear on top of other pages) <i>Demo: Login form is a popup</i></li>      <li>Custom transition for each page. <i>Demo: Member page</i></li>      <li>Page redirection. <i>Demo: Redirection from Researches top page to Research Intro</i></li>      <li>Linking page redirect users to an external URL<i>. Demo: Forum</i></li>      <li>Page accessibilty which requires authentication<i>. Demo: Works (who wants to see this page may contact me for the password)</i></li>   </ul> </ul>  <ul>   <li>Deep linking (AKA <a href="http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/" target="_blank">SWFAddress</a>). </li> </ul>  <ul>   <ul>     <li>The deeplinking module can be activated or omitted completely from project's build </li>      <li>Page system has deep linking by default (if deep linkng is activated).<i> Demo: All pages in the demo</i></li>      <li>Especially, each page can implement its own sub-deeplink logic. This is an unprecedented feature which never be seen in other frameworks. <i>Demo: Gallery page</i></li>   </ul> </ul>  <ul>   <li>Multilingual support and dynamic fonts loading. A unique text style manager which centralized all fonts assets and styles. No character is embeded twice. </li>    <li>A tracking manager which is designed to handle multiple tracking services at the same time. Trackers can be activated/deactivated completely from source code. Currently support Omniture, Webtrends and GoogleAnalytics. Future tracking services can be plugged in easily. </li>    <li>Common utilities and controls: Scrollbar, Tooltip, StringUtil, Cookies, Random...</li>    <li>Other modules and features to bundle in the framework: TBD</li> </ul>  <p>We are currently making the documents and API reference for it. Next step is to train every member of the team the usage of PFF.</p>
