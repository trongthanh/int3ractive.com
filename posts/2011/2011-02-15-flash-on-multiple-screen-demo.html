<p>2011 undoubtedly expects the multiple screen applications trend. Flash platform is one of the best solutions to deliver same experience across multiple devices and platforms. Here is a demo of Flash-based games on multiple (device) screens: PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone (Motorola Milestone 2), Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab).</p>  <p>All the coding effort is credited to my Flash team. The iOS applications were created by using Flash CS5â€™s iPhone Packager. I repackaged the Flash builds to AIR for Android using Flex SDK Hero. Some of the applications are not complete and/or Android-optimized yet.</p>  <p><iframe title="YouTube video player" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AN5BgrDOY58" frameborder="0" width="640" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>FYI, the video was created with <a href="http://cinelerra.org/" target="_blank">Cinelerra</a>, the most advanced non-linear video editor and compositor for Linux. (Quite close to Adobe Premiere, and require some learning curve)</p>
