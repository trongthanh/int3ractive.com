<p>This post of mine is to bookmark any interesting read related to or address those debates, especially, the so-called “The Great Flash vs HTML5 Debate of 2010”. I admit that I’m bias so maybe most of the links here are pro-Flash. Anyway, you can read the comments for counter-arguments but I’ve seen a lot of *bullshit* yell-outs against Flash with no proof or reasonable points at all.</p>  <p>I’ll update this post regularly whenever I come across any read-worthy articles (and sort them in chronological order).</p> <a name='more'></a>

With the ability to update the majority of Web clients in less than a year, Flash can make this innovation available to our customers much more quickly than HTML across a variety of browsers.&rdquo;<br />Follow up the post, Kevin has a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/02/open_access_to_content_and_app.html#comment-2137153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> reveal Flash team effort to prevent crash: <br /> &ldquo;Before we release a new version of Flash Player we run more than 100,000 test cases and have built an automated system that has scanned over 1 million SWFs that we use for testing from across the web. Our QA lab has a very large variety of machines to represent the machines in real use on the web.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>**** Grant Skinner&rsquo;s </strong><a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2010/02/my_thoughts_on.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>thought on the future of Flash</strong></a> &ndash; 2010-02-03 <br /> &rdquo;This skill set is applicable to so many things: WPF on Windows, Cocoa development on Mac / iPhone (ex. Core Animation), Silverlight, mobile development, and of course the emerging HTML 5 standard. Languages are easy to learn - mental models, process, and the experience gained from years of working with rich interactive are a whole lot harder.&rdquo;</li>

Any issues with mouse input on a touch device are not specific to Flash, but affect all content, including HTML based content.&rdquo;</li>

[&hellip;] <br />We will still be shipping the ability to target the iPhone and iPad in Flash CS5. However, we are not currently planning any additional investments in that feature.&rdquo;</li>

Well yeah. The specs are open meaning that everyone can download those specs and build an application around it to display that language. [&hellip;] That sounds a lot like Flash! The specs for [FLV, SWF, AMF and RTMP] are all published and can be downloaded by anyone.&rdquo;</li>
