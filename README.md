## Post's Front Matter Guide

- `title`: Post title, `h1` of the post page
- `tags`: A one-line list of tags (I'm indenting with tabs so multiline yaml list is not possible)
- `metaTitle`: Optional, set to override the `<title>` and `og:title`  at page's metadata
- `metaDesc`: Optional, set for meta descriptions
- `image`: Optional, set for `og:image` and social network sharing image
- `coverImage`: Optional, set for the post's cover photo, will also be used as social image if `image` is not provided.
- `updated`: Optional, set to display an updated date

Some legacy front matter fields not currently in used but may be in the future:

- `author`: just me as author
- `subtitle`: previous theme has subtitle below title
- `cover-darken`: used to applied CSS darken overlay to cover photo, it's not needed anymore.

## The Theme: A modified Hylia 11ty blog starter

This new blog theme is based on [Hylia starter kit for Eleventy](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) (archived).

## CHANGELOG

- Again, change to use serif (**Lora**) as body text font and sans as heading / title font.
- Added `markdown-it-attrs` and use `{: ... }` delimiters (similar to Ruby Kramdown) to add custom attributes to generated HTML elements.
- Added **all tags** page and **other tags** under posts list by tag.
- Added archive view by year at `/blog/YYYY/` URL
- Re-configured markdown filter to enable smart quotes
- Fix few rendering issues

## New URL scheme from my previous Jekyll-based site:

```
int3ractive.com              -> Home page
int3ractive.com/blog/        -> Blog page containing all posts (was archive/)
