I have just migrated my blog from Blogger to GitHub Pages which under the hood is a static site generated with Jekyll, and use a minimalist theme which was created by [Clean Blog author]. I am so far happy with it.

My ultimate motivation of this move is the frustration of maintaining a long post's format and hierarchy across multiple platforms and editors. The blog post needed review and edit from different people, so I used Google Doc as the collaborating platform. But its rich format didn't play nice with Blogger's WYSWYG editor, so I had to paste the content as plain text and did the formating and even URL linking all over again. It was when I realized that, rich text editors are great nuisances to 


Other Reasons: 
- Blogger's WYSWYG is way out-dated and lousy. It handles new lines poorly and makes my posts, underneath, like a single paragraph with just line breaks.
- Blogger XML-based template format is difficult to use and customize. Not to mention that it doesn't provide a separate CSS storage but inlining into output HTML.
- There is no static file storage for the blog post's extras. Although it come with handy photo uploading service, for other stuff like downloadable assets and code demos, I had to reside on other services like Github or FileDen which often have cross domain issues or risk of service termination.

Overcome shortcomings of a static website:
- Comments
- Site search
- RSS
- No tags & categories 
-
