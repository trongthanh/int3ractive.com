Here are some of my open source or contributed-to projects through out my career, ordered by date with later ones on top:

## Data visualization collections

[![Data viz collection screenshot](/img/projects/data-viz.png){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://viz.int3ractive.com)

My next interest in Web Front End is data visualization in which it demands key expertises of a FE engineer such as drawing, animation, interaction and layout.

I'm practicing _data viz_ and show them at [viz.int3ractive.com](https://viz.int3ractive.com).

## [node-vn-payments](https://github.com/naustudio/node-vn-payments)

[![node-vn-payment screenshot](/img/projects/node-vn-payments.png){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://github.com/naustudio/node-vn-payments)

My team and I have gathered a set of JavaScript classes (written in ES6) that help NodeJS apps exchange data with some common Vietnamese payment gateways with more confidence and ease by validating payload object and normalize multiple gateways specs into a common API.

## [VueJS Shopping Cart, a PWA demo](https://github.com/trongthanh/vuejs-firebase-shopping-cart)

My daylight job is mainly focused on ReactJS. VueJS is new, and I wanted learn more about it via an exercise. I've enhanced a VueJS shopping cart with PWA capabilities to learn and also do demo for my talks.

## [date-fns vi locale](https://date-fns.org/)

[![date-fns thumbnail](/img/projects/date-fns.png){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://date-fns.org/)

One of my projects used `date-fns` in stead of `momentjs` because it has better tree-shaking. However, by the time I looked at it, it didn't have Vietnamese locale yet. So I has contributed the [**vi** locale package](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/v2.0.0-alpha.7/src/locale/vi) for this project.

---

## [Nau Chrome Tab](https://github.com/trongthanh/nau-chrome-tab/)

[![Nau chrome tab screenshot](/img/projects/nau-chrome-tab.jpg){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://github.com/trongthanh/nau-chrome-tab/)

A browser extension which replace new tab page with full screen wallpaper, quick links, inspired quotations and clock. Yeah, it's a copy of Momentum extension, but this one is light weight, no tracking, and I wrote it from scratch.

---

## [Nau Jukebox](https://github.com/naustudio/nau-jukebox)

[![Nau Jukebox screenshot](/img/projects/nau-jukebox.png){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://github.com/naustudio/nau-jukebox)

A [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) real-time jukebox in which users can collectively book songs from various sources to listen together. This web app is live at [jukebox.naustud.io](https://jukebox.naustud.io) and our team is using it regularly.

## [Nau Studio's Code Hub](https://code.naustud.io)

[![Nau Studio's Code Hub screenshot](/img/projects/nau-code.png){: align="left" width="200" class="media-thumbnail"}](https://code.naustud.io)

I have gathered a set of conventions and workflow tooling for my team. They include linter's config, editor's config, style guide documentation, yeoman generators and dotfiles. Check out [Nau's code standards site](https://code.naustud.io) for more info.

As part of buddy Justin's portfolio site, this fish boid simulation is derived from ThreeJS birds demo.

One of my earliest code doodle with JavaScript and [THREE.JS](link-to-threejs). This is a virtual walk-through of my _then_ office in 360 view.
