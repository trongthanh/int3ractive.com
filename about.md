I co-founded [Nau Studio](https://naustud.io) and [Goalify.plus](https://goalify.plus) and currently take the role of Principal Web Engineer at [Chotot.com](https://chotot.com). My entire career so far has been on the Web platform, since before HTML5 era until now with mobile first and progressive web apps. I have a passion of making the Web a great experience for users and an enjoyable platform for developers. Currently I'm exploring workflow for front end which involves design systems, designer-developer collaborations, code standards and discipline that helps product's quality and delivery's productivity. I'm also interested in large scale front end architect, web app performance optimization and new tooling for web app development. Regarding community, I enjoy sharing knowledge via blogging and speaking. I was honored to be invited as speaker in several tech talks and workshops including Vietnam Web Summits, Vietnam Mobile Day...

In the past, I was a senior Flash developer and joined in as a speaker of Vietnam's first [Flash Camp conference](https://int3ractive.com/2010/12/flash-camp-hanoi-2010.html). I wrote several demos and case studies in ActionScript and JavaScript which can be found in [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/trongthanh). I used to worked in Singapore for two and a half years, during which I gained my international experience in a multimedia agency and a production house. Now I am back in Vietnam, and quite busy with daily work, but I am still passionate in building a [front end developers community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hcmfrontend/) and have a dream of bringing the [JSConf](http://jsconf.com) to Vietnam.

This blog was created in 2008 on Blogger platform to share my experiments and discoveries during the advancement of my career. It was a bit dusty through out 2013 and 2014 during which I was drawn into too much work and other personal matters. Since 2015, I felt like writing again and decided to migrate it to [GitHub Pages](https://int3ractive.com/2015/09/goodbye-blogger-hello-github-pages.html) and in 2020, to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/) where I am free from the clutter of CMS and WYSIWYG editors and can really focus on writing. Although most of Vietnamese developers can read in English, I think will write more in Vietnamese so that the things I share will be hopefully more approachable for my fellow developers.
