## FAQ & Back story:

<details>
  <summary>1. Why is it called <strong>NAU Tab</strong>?</summary>
  <p>This browser extension was originally made as new tab for <strong>NAU</strong> Studio's team with quick links to our internal resources and websites. As I'm making this extension standalone, I'd like to keep the original name, but now as acronym for: <strong><u>N</u>ot <u>A</u>nother <u>U</u>seless Tab</strong></p>
